                <p>Microblading eyebrows is a form of permanent makeup that creates natural, beautiful eyebrows with a
                    handheld microblade. It’s perfect for people who have overplucked or those who want to define,
                    darken or reshape their eyebrows.</p>
                 <p>Microblading originated in Asia over 20 years ago and has gone by many names: eyebrow embroidery,
                    feather touch, microstroking and even “the Japanese Method.” By 2015, microblading became popular in
                    the United States.</p>
                 <p>Technically, microblading is a form of eyebrow tattooing. But unlike traditional tattooing, which
                    uses a machine, microblading artists apply each hairstroke with a handheld microblade. This produces
                    a very fine line that resembles real hair. Each individual hairstroke is hand drawn by the artist
                    and blended in with the client’s existing eyebrow hair. With a strong artist at the helm, the
                    results can be gorgeous and very lifelike.</p>
                <p>Microblading typically takes two appointments to complete. In the first appointment, the client is
                    profiled and the eyebrows are drawn on with a waterproof pencil, so the artist and client can agree
                    on the look. The artist then microblades the eyebrows and the client is ready to go back into the
                    world. There is some mild scabbing and aftercare required, but your microblading should be
                    completely healed in 30 days.
                    The second appointment is a touch up at least 30 days after the first session. This allows enough
                    time for the ink in the epidermis to naturally slough off, and the color to settle into your skin.
                    In the touch up appointment, the artist can see how your skin has received the ink and make any
                    necessary corrections.
                    Sometimes a client’s skin undertones may have unexpected effects on the ink’s color, and the artist
                    may need to add color to adjust. These kind of corrections are normal with any microblading artist
                    and an essential part of the process, as everyone’s skin is different and receives ink differently.
